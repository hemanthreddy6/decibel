Optimizations currently happening in decibel:

1. When loading a wav file, we extract and store minimal info in struct Audio 
    which would allow us to construct an wav file back after performing multiple audio operations.

2. Storing the samples of both audio channels together within struct Audio. 
    This helps us optimize the implementations of various audio operations and reduces the memory footprint by 50%.

3. All other optimizations provided by LLVM on the generated LLVM code.

More possible optimizations:

1. Reordering operations on audio / cross operator optimisations. 
    Eg: When an intermediary value in an audio expression is not being assigned anywhere, 
    it would be more memory efficient to do the operation on the audio in-place, instead of creating a new audio file.

2. Parallelize audio playback and generation to run simultaneously on different threads.

3. Constant propagation for audio operations
